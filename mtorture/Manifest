t1*     Infrastructure to run ArrayTest benchmarks.

t1-0/   Initial ArrayTest run:
        - Make sure everything works and behaves reasonably.
        - Compare vectorization on/off results.
        - Start developing plotting tools.

t1-1/   Compare different ArrayTest features:
        - sum2 vs. sum3 (access 3 or 4 arrays)
        - various sum2 and sum3 functions among themselves.
